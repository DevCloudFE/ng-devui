# How to use

Import into the module:

```ts
import { RelativeTimeModule } from 'ng-devui/relative-time';
```
on the pageï¼š
```
<div>{{ value | dRelativeTime: limit }}</div>
```
## Conversion Rule

```javascript
Compared with the current time:
If the difference between different years is greater than 3 months, convert the value to year. Otherwise, convert the value to month.
If the difference between months is more than four weeks, the value is converted to a month. Otherwise, the value is converted to a week.
If the difference is greater than 6 days and the week is different from the same week, convert it to a week. Otherwise, convert it to a day.
If the time difference between the two days is greater than 6 hours, convert the time difference to day. Otherwise, convert the time difference to hour.
If the time difference is greater than 59 minutes, the value is converted to hour. Otherwise, the value is converted to minute.
If the time difference is greater than 59 seconds and the time difference is greater than 59 seconds, the value is changed to minute. Otherwise, the value is changed to just or later.
The limit parameter is accepted. When the time difference exceeds the limit, no conversion is performed.
